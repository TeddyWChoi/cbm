                                We use advertising cookies to customize the advertising that is shown to you on the
                                Services and on third-party websites and services. We allow third parties, including our
                                analytics providers, advertising networks, and other advertising service providers, to
                                collect information about your use of the Services across your applications and your
                                different devices using cookies and similar technologies. These third parties may use
                                this information to display advertisements on our Services and elsewhere online across
                                different sites and services tailored to your interests, preferences, and
                                characteristics. You can control the use and disclosure of the information for such
                                purposes through Your Choices.

                        <br />
                        CBM provides you with a variety of choices to control the use and sharing of your information,
                        including:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Email Communications. You may opt out of receiving commercial email messages from us by
                        following the unsubscribe instructions provided in our emails. Please note that even if you have
                        opted out of receiving commercial email messages, you may continue to receive messages related
                        to your account, your transactions, and similar service-related messages.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Geolocation Information. Your device may enable you to control the collection of your precise
                        geolocation information, and whether this information is shared with third parties, through the
                        settings on your device. Please note that you may need to adjust multiple settings, and not just
                        your location permissions, to opt out of providing precise location information. If you opt out
                        of providing precise geolocation information, we may continue to derive your approximate
                        location from your IP address and other information we may collect. For more information, please
                        review your device settings.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Cookies and Similar Technologies. You may be able to refuse or disable cookies by adjusting your
                        web browser settings. Because each web browser is different, please consult the instructions
                        provided by your web browser (typically in the “help” section). Please note that you may need to
                        take additional steps to refuse or disable local storage and similar technologies. For example,
                        Adobe Local Shared Objects can be controlled through the instructions on Adobe’s Setting Manager
                        page. Deleting the cookies in your browser may in some cases cancel your choices for
                        interest-based advertising. If you choose to refuse, disable, or delete cookies and similar
                        technologies, some of the functionality of the Services may no longer be available to you.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Do Not Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track”
                        signals to the websites with which the user communicates. CBM currently does not take action in
                        response to these signals.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Interest-Based Advertising. While it is not possible to turn off all advertising, you do have
                        the ability to control whether you receive interest-based ads based on information collected or
                        received about your online activities and interests over time and across unaffiliated sites and
                        services and your different devices. You can opt out of receiving interest-based ads from
                        companies that participate in self-regulatory programs such as the Network Advertising
                        Initiative (US) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (US), EDAA (EU), and DAAC (Canada) by
                        following the instructions provided on their websites. If you are using a mobile app, you also
                        may need to opt out of interest-based advertising on your mobile device or through the mobile
                        application. For more information, check your device and mobile app settings. Please note that
                        your opt-out choice will apply only to the browser and device you are using when you opt out.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Other Game and Device Permissions. You may be able to adjust your privacy settings for push
                        notifications, address book sharing, and other information or features within the Services or
                        your device permissions. Please review the settings for the Services and your device for more
                        information. To stop the collection of information by a CBM game, you can uninstall the game
                        using the standard uninstall process available on your device or the app marketplace or network
                        from which you installed the game.

                        <br />
                        The laws in your country may provide you rights to request access to, correct, restrict, port,
                        copy, or delete your information, request that we stop processing your information or delete
                        your account, or withdraw or change the scope of your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we
                        will stop processing your information for such purposes, but it will not affect the processing
                        of information previously covered by your consent. Where technologically feasible and required
                        by applicable law, we will port your information pursuant to your reasonable request. A request
                        to withdraw consent, restrict or stop processing your information, or delete your account or
                        information may result in your inability to access the Services or some of its features. To
                        exercise your rights consistent with applicable law, please contact us.

                        <h5>6. CHILDREN</h5>
                        <br />
                        We do not knowingly collect or sell personal information from children who are under the age of
                        13 (or the age otherwise defined under applicable law) without parental consent or unless
                        permitted by applicable law. If we become aware that personal information has been collected
                        through our Services from a child under the applicable age, we will delete that information and
                        any account associated with that user. If you believe we have collected information from a child
                        under the applicable age, please contact us.
                        <br />

                        <h5>7. HOW WE SECURE AND HOW LONG WE STORE INFORMATION</h5>
                        <br />
                        We maintain reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, organizational, and procedural
                        safeguards to protect your information. While we take reasonable precautions against possible
                        loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, no storage system or transmission of data over the
                        Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. Data we collect will be retained only for so long as
                        reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above, unless applicable law requires otherwise.
                        Please note that information collected by third parties may not have the same security
                        protections as information you submit to us, and we are not responsible for protecting the
                        security of such information. <br />

                        <h5>8. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h5>
                        <br />
                        Information we collect may be transferred to countries outside your home country for the
                        purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. You understand that these countries, including Korea
                        and the United States, may not provide the same level of data privacy protection as the European
                        Union/European Economic Area or your home country, and you hereby expressly consent to the
                        transfer of your information to these countries for processing in accordance with this Privacy
                        Policy. These transfers are essential to the provision of our Services and performance of the
                        Terms of Service and End User License Agreement.
