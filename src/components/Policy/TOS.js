                        <br />
                        Limited License. Subject to these Terms, you may access and use the Services running operating

                        entertainment use only. The Services are licensed, not sold, to you on a limited, revocable,
                        non-sublicensable, nontransferable, and non-exclusive basis. You may not modify, copy (except
                        for a single backup copy and transient copying required to operate the Services), distribute,
                        transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, create derivative works from or adapt, sell,
                        rent, lease, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or make available the Services or any portion
                        thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree that you have no right to
                        sell or otherwise transfer any of the virtual items, virtual currency, points, or any other
                        content or information from the Services, in whole or in part, on internet auction sites (such
                        as eBay or IGE), hack sites, private server sites, gold farming sites, or any other third-party
                        sites or services or in return for anything of value (whether real money or otherwise). You have
                        no rights in or to the Services unless expressly granted to you under these Terms. Your license
                        is automatically rescinded and terminated if you breach any provision of the Terms.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Additional Terms. Some of the Services are subject to and governed by additional terms,
                        conditions, rules, or guidelines on permissible use (“Additional Terms”). We will make these
                        Additional Terms available to you through the applicable service, in which case your acceptance
                        of such Additional Terms is required before you may use the applicable service. If any of the
                        covenants of this agreement conflict with any terms and conditions of Additional Terms, the
                        Additional Terms shall supersede this agreement with respect to the subject matter addressed in
                        the Additional Terms.

                        supervision of a parent or legal guardian that has reviewed and agreed to these Terms. Children

                        provide any personal information to CBM or others through the Services, without parental
                        consent.

                        <br />
                        Account Registration. Some of our Services require you to create an account with us. If you are
                        not signed into your account, you might not be able to access some portions or features of the
                        Services. When creating an account, you will provide only accurate and complete information, and
                        promptly update this information. You will keep your username and password confidential and
                        secure, and will not use the same password that you use for other websites or services. You will
                        uninstall and delete the Services before transferring any device on which they are installed.

                        SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN YOUR ACCOUNT, AND YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE
                        AND AGREE THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO THE ACCOUNT ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO

                        may not, and may not offer to, purchase, sell, gift, or trade any account. Any such attempt
                        shall be null and void and may result in the termination and forfeiture of the account. Any
                        account which has been dormant for more than one year may expire and be deleted.

                        sole discretion. You acknowledge and agree that CBM may provide updates to you remotely and
                        automatically, including by (without limitation) accessing the device on which you use the
                        Services. Any updates provided or made available by CBM are part of the Services and will be
                        subject to these Terms.

                        these Terms and provision of the Services may require transfer of the information that we
                        collect from your country to other countries, which may not provide the same level of protection
                        as the European Union/European Economic Area or your home country.

                        <br />
                        While using the Services, you may have the opportunity to visit online and in-game stores where
                        you can obtain and use CBM’s virtual currency and digital, in-game items (including early access
                        to games still in production, as may be offered from time to time). CBM also may make points
                        available to you in connection with your use of the Services.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        VIRTUAL CONTENTS, INCLUDING VIRTUAL CONTENTS EXCHANGED FOR PREPAID PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS, ARE
                        REGARDED AS GOODS OR SERVICES, AND ARE NOT PREPAID PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS. Virtual currency and
                        points have no “real-world” value but may be exchanged for in-game items. Items from such stores
                        are not purchased by you, but rather are licensed to you under these Terms. REGARDLESS OF THE
                        CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCY, YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY OWNERSHIP
                        RIGHTS IN THE ITEMS OBTAINED WITH VIRTUAL CURRENCY.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Any prices, quotations and descriptions made or referred to on our Services do not constitute an
                        offer and may be withdrawn or revised at any time before CBM’s express acceptance of your order.
                        To the extent permitted under applicable law, you agree to pay all charges, fees, and applicable
                        taxes incurred by you or anyone else using your account or resulting from use of the Services on
                        your device at the price(s) in effect when such charges occurred. CBM may change the pricing for
                        the Services at any time consistent with applicable law. CBM reserves the right to notify you of
                        any mistakes in product descriptions or errors in pricing prior to product dispatch. If that
                        happens, and you choose to continue with fulfilment of the order, you acknowledge that the
                        product or service will be provided in accordance with such revised description or corrected
                        price.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Different payment methods, such as credit card, direct debit, PayPal, etc., may be available to
                        you when obtaining virtual currency through the Services. When you use third-party payment and
                        billing providers, such as PayPal or Paymentwall, that provider’s additional terms, conditions,
                        and costs, apply. It is your obligation to pay all federal, state, and local taxes associated
                        with the receipt or use of the virtual items which you purchase from CBM.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Certain minimums may apply to purchases of virtual currency, and certain maximums may apply
                        depending on your transaction method. CBM reserves the right to change the maximum and minimum
                        amounts applicable to virtual currency purchases at any time without notice, consistent with
                        applicable law.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT CBM WILL NOT OFFER REFUNDS FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR DIGITAL,
                        IN-GAME ITEMS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF
                        YOUR ACCOUNT, THESE TERMS, OR THE SERVICES, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW. FOR
                        RESIDENTS OF THE EEA OR OF THE UNITED KINGDOM ONLY: YOU AGREE TO IMMEDIATELY RECEIVE THE DIGITAL
                        PRODUCTS, INCLUDING VIRTUAL CURRENCY, DIGITAL IN-GAME ITEMS AND ANY OTHER VIRTUAL CONTENTS, AND
                        TO WAIVE YOUR CANCELLATION AND REFUND RIGHT ONCE THE DOWNLOAD OR STREAMING OF THE DIGITAL
                        PRODUCT HAS BEGUN. If an account is permanently banned, all content licenses and virtual
                        currency balances associated with the suspended account are forfeited. CBM will have no
                        obligation or responsibility to and will not reimburse you for any virtual currency, points,
                        items, or experience lost due to your violation of these Terms.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Items may expire. Each item that you obtain using virtual currency or points will be included in
                        your account until the earlier of the item’s expiration date, termination or expiration of your
                        account, these Terms, or the Services. Price and availability of items are subject to change
                        without notice, consistent with applicable law.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We may suspend or terminate your account if for any reason a charge you authorize us to make to
                        your credit card or SMS/phone billing cannot be processed or is returned to us unpaid or
                        refunded and, if such event occurs, you shall immediately remit to us payment for such charge
                        through the use of another credit card or other payment mechanism. We are not responsible or
                        liable for any credit card or bank-related charges or fees related to any of your transactions.
                        We reserve the right, without prior notification, to limit the order quantity on any item or to
                        refuse to provide you with any item. You may be required to verify your transaction information
                        prior to our acceptance thereof.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Notwithstanding these Terms, the laws in your country may apply to the purchase of virtual goods
                        and services supplied by CBM to you and you may have rights or remedies as set out in such laws
                        that apply in addition to, or, to the extent that they are inconsistent, instead of, the rights
                        or remedies set out in these Terms.
